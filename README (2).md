Sentiment-Aware Customer Service Chatbot
This project implements a sentiment-aware chatbot designed to enhance customer service by detecting and responding to user emotions in real time. By analyzing the sentiment of customer messages, the chatbot can adapt its tone, prioritize issues, and provide a more empathetic and personalized experience.

1. Problem Statement
The goal is to move beyond a standard, rule-based chatbot that provides generic responses regardless of a customer's emotional state. A frustrated customer receiving a purely rational or impersonal response can lead to an escalation of the issue and a negative customer experience. The challenge is to build a system that can understand the emotional tone of a user's message and adjust its response to be more empathetic or encouraging, which can help de-escalate negative situations and improve overall customer satisfaction.

2. Dataset
This project relies on a pre-trained model fine-tuned on a specific dataset for sentiment analysis.

SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2): This dataset is a binary single-sentence classification task that consists of sentences from movie reviews. The neutral class was removed, so the data is classified as either positive or negative. It's a standard benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding systems.

The chatbot's sentiment analysis model, DistilBERT, was fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset, which makes it effective at classifying the sentiment of new, unseen text inputs.

3. Methodology
The chatbot's architecture is a combination of a sentiment analysis model and a rule-based response system, all integrated within a Gradio interface.

Sentiment Analysis Model: The project uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and more efficient version of the BERT language model. It's pre-trained with knowledge distillation, where a smaller "student" model (DistilBERT) learns to replicate the behavior of a larger "teacher" model (BERT). DistilBERT retains 97% of BERT's performance while being 40% smaller and 60% faster, making it an excellent choice for real-time applications like a chatbot.

Sentiment-Aware Logic: The SentimentAwareChatbot class first analyzes the user's message using the loaded DistilBERT model to get a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral) and a confidence score.

Dynamic Response Generation: Based on the detected sentiment and its confidence score, the chatbot selects an appropriate emotional prefix for its response. For example, if the sentiment is negative with a high score, it might add a phrase like "I understand your frustration. I'm here to assist you.".

Rule-Based Core: The chatbot's core response is generated by a rule-based system that looks for keywords in the user's message (e.g., "problem," "return," "thank you") to provide a relevant answer.

Gradio Interface: A user-friendly Gradio interface provides a chat window and a real-time analytics dashboard. This dashboard tracks and displays a summary of the conversation's sentiment, showing the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral messages.

4. Results
The project successfully delivers a chatbot that can:

Detect Sentiment in Real-Time: The chatbot accurately classifies user messages as positive, negative, or neutral with a high confidence score. This capability serves as an early warning system for customer frustration, allowing the chatbot to proactively de-escalate issues.

Adapt its Responses: The chatbot demonstrates its ability to adjust its tone and language based on the detected sentiment, providing a more empathetic and personalized user experience.

Track Customer Satisfaction: The real-time analytics dashboard provides a summary of the conversation history, including sentiment distribution and average scores. This provides valuable data for businesses to identify patterns of discontent and improve service quality.

Enhance Brand Reputation: By detecting negative sentiments early and responding appropriately, the chatbot helps prevent minor issues from escalating and can even route frustrated customers to a human agent, protecting brand reputation and loyalty.
